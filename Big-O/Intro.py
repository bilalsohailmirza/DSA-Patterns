# Time and Space Complexity

# 1 < n < 100

# Big O() -> refers to the upper bound (worst case)

# Common Complexities in the discusison of Big O are:
# 1. O(n)
# 2. O(n^2)
# 3. O(n^3)
# 4. O(log n)
# 5. O(n logn)

# The rate at which your algorithm grows (in terms of execution time)
# we have a cashier at a mart
#  it takes 10 minutes (on average) for the cashier to deal 1 customer
# how long will it take the cashier to deal with 100 customers
